# Automatic Solar Panel Tracker

This project is a microcontroller-based automatic solar panel tracking system that enhances solar energy efficiency by adjusting the panelâ€™s position according to the direction of sunlight.

# Working Principle

The system operates using two LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensors to detect sunlight intensity from both directions. Here's how it works:

- The analog signals from the LDRs are routed through a **74HC4051 multiplexer** to the **ADC0804**, which converts the signals into digital values.
- The **AT89C51 microcontroller** reads these digital values and compares them:
  - If the **left LDR** receives more light, the motor rotates the solar panel **left**.
  - If the **right LDR** receives more light, the panel rotates **right**.
- When both readings are nearly equal (e.g., in cloudy conditions), the system switches to **time-based control** using a **DS1307 RTC (Real-Time Clock)**. The panel is then adjusted based on the sun's expected position during the day.

This ensures **continuous and efficient solar tracking** throughout the day, regardless of weather conditions.
